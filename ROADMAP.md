## Phase 1 — Lock the Core ✅

**Theme:** Make the current design impossible to misunderstand or misuse.

### ✅ Stabilize the "reasoning ABI"

Frozen schemas (v1):
- **State representation** — Grid-based with solution
- **Action schema** — `place`, `move`, `eliminate` operations
- **Step trace format** — chuk-gym-core `Step` with 7 fields

### ✅ Golden trace tests

- Snapshot tests for puzzle → trace → solution
- CI asserts determinism and legality
- `tests/test_trace_generator.py` (40 tests)

### ✅ README upgrade

- What problem this solves (cold start + RL)
- Why steps > CoT (verifiable reasoning)
- How to use in training loop (Dataset Export section)

---

## Phase 2 — Dataset as a Product ✅

**Theme:** Make it trivial to *use the data* without caring about the gym internals.

### ✅ Standard dataset exports

```bash
# JSONL with full traces
chuk-puzzles-export -o puzzles.jsonl

# Specific games/difficulties
chuk-puzzles-export -g sudoku kenken -d easy medium -n 1000
```

Output includes:
- Problem definition (prompt, initial_state, gold_answer)
- Step-by-step traces (operation, before/after, rule, explanation)
- Constraint metadata and difficulty profiles

### ⏳ Cold-start packs (TODO)

Prebuilt datasets:
- `easy-forced-only` — Single-candidate deductions only
- `medium-no-backtracking` — Forward reasoning, no guessing
- `hard-with-branching` — Requires search/backtracking

Each tagged with:
- Puzzle type and difficulty
- Reasoning skills involved
- Optimal step count

### ✅ Baseline metrics

`chuk-puzzles-eval` provides:
- Solve rate
- Average steps / optimal steps
- Invalid move rate
- Wall clock time

```bash
chuk-puzzles-eval -g sudoku -n 100 -o json > baseline.json
```

---

## Phase 3 — RL Loop First-Class

**Theme:** Show the *full loop* working, cheaply.

### ✅ Gymnasium Environment

```python
from chuk_puzzles_gym.gym_env import PuzzleEnv

env = PuzzleEnv("sudoku", difficulty="medium", seed=42)
obs, info = env.reset()

while not done:
    action = agent.decide(obs)
    obs, reward, done, truncated, info = env.step(action)
```

### ✅ Verifier-driven rewards

Configurable reward components:
- `correct_placement` — Valid move toward solution
- `invalid_attempt` — Rejected move penalty
- `completion_bonus` — Puzzle solved
- `efficiency_multiplier` — Bonus for optimal steps

```python
from chuk_puzzles_gym.models import SolverConfig

config = SolverConfig(
    solver_enabled=False,  # Pure reasoning mode
    hint_penalty=0.1,
)
```

### ⏳ Reference training loop (TODO)

Minimal example showing:
```
SFT on traces → rollout in env → verifier reward → PPO update
```

### ⏳ Curriculum scheduler (TODO)

Auto-advance difficulty based on:
- Solve rate threshold
- Invalid step rate
- Average branching depth encountered

---

## Phase 4 — Ecosystem Integration

**Theme:** Make this slot cleanly into the CHUK stack *and* external workflows.

### ⏳ MCP + Solver bridge (TODO)

- Gym episode ↔ MCP solver calls
- Step traces usable as tool-call supervision
- Connects to `chuk-mcp-solver`

### ⏳ Plugin puzzle API (TODO)

Let others add puzzles via:
- Schema definition
- Solver adapter
- Step explainer

No core changes needed.

### ⏳ Leaderboard (TODO)

Track:
- Tiny models (< 1B params)
- Heuristic agents
- RL-trained agents

Focus on **efficiency**, not just accuracy.

---

## Phase 5 — Research & Splash

**Theme:** Make noise with minimal compute.

### ⏳ "$100 reasoning model" experiment

Train:
- TinyLlama or similar small model
- Only on puzzle data (SFT + short RL)

Compare against:
- Base model (zero-shot)
- Larger general models on puzzles

### ⏳ Positioning paper / blog

> "Why solver-grounded steps beat chain-of-thought"

Use own results to demonstrate.

## TL;DR Summary

| 1 | Lock core | ✅ Complete |
| 2 | Datasets | ✅ Mostly complete (cold-start packs TODO) |
| 3 | RL loop | ✅ Env done, training loop TODO |
| 4 | Ecosystem | ⏳ Not started |
| 5 | Splash | ⏳ Not started |
